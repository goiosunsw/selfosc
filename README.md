# SelfOsc

Self oscillating valves coupled to acoustic resonators

## Aim

Provides different methods of simulating acoustic resonators, and solving coupled equations to 
self-oscillating valves.

* Uses scipy's nonlinear solvers to find solutions for non-linear equations

## Example cases

* Vocal folds as self-oscillating valves coupled to vocal tracts and/or subglottal tracts
* Reed or lip musical instruments such as trumpets or clarinets
